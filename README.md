# ui.desktop.kit

Built with [Norm](https://github.com/normlanguage/Norm).

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

JavaFX components built on [ui](https://github.com/normlanguage/ui), [ui.desktop](https://github.com/normlanguage/ui.desktop), and [ui.theme](https://github.com/normlanguage/ui.theme).

## Use

```norm
dependency(repository: "github", name: "ui.desktop.kit", version: 16)
```

Set `Card(sectionGap: 12.0, ...)` to separate a custom header or footer from the body. The default is zero.

Use the public Norm widgets, bindings and field models defined by [module.norm](ui/desktop/kit/module.norm). Native component adapters are private implementation details. Applications that need JavaFX types import `ui.desktop.native.*` and use [nativeComponent](https://github.com/normlanguage/ui.desktop/blob/main/ui/desktop/native.norm).

Layout and UI configuration protocols belong to `ui`; this library provides components and component-specific configuration. Typed form validation and reset are defined in [form.norm](ui/desktop/kit/form.norm).

## Examples

[Application examples](samples/README.md) cover task editing, typed order forms, and cancellable file work with virtualized rows.

The [gallery](samples/gallery/application.norm) and its [catalog](samples/gallery/catalog.norm) cover the component API. Its [module](samples/gallery/module.norm) resolves released packages by default. Gallery documentation, styling, images and capture support live in a separate sample artifact; they are not part of the production component JAR.

## Build and verify

Run `./scripts/prepare.ps1 -UiRoot <ui-source>` to build the artifacts and verify the pinned component digest and module. Run `./scripts/update-pin.ps1 -UiRoot <ui-source>` intentionally after changing Java artifacts. Verification does not rewrite descriptors. Use an explicit `-NormHome` containing source-built dependencies for integration work; regular descriptors remain released dependency declarations.

Gallery documentation embeds the public UI source from an explicit `-UiRoot` input. Use the [`ui`](https://github.com/normlanguage/ui/releases/tag/v11) release source for published artifact verification. Missing source files fail the build.

[build.gradle.kts](build.gradle.kts) owns Java dependencies, reproducible archives and tests. Java tests generate theme fixtures through [the fixture entry point](samples/fixtures/application.norm), using the canonical `ui.desktop.themeCss`. The default test task includes theme rendering contracts. `-PskipThemeFixtures` is available for focused tests that do not use CSS fixtures.

[Norm tests](ui/desktop/kit/tests), [Java tests](src/test/java/dev/normlanguage/ui/component), and [gallery window tests](samples/gallery/tests) own executable verification. The [workflow](.github/workflows/package.yml) owns release checks.

## Desktop workspaces

Module 11 provides NavigationItem(title, action, subtitle, selected), SectionHeading(title, description), and SettingRow(title, control, description). Rows use vertical whitespace without separators. Navigation items reserve room for two lines and use the existing theme selection tokens.


`Button(icon: "mdi2r-refresh", ...)` adds a leading icon. Set `iconSize` for its visual size and `iconOnly: true` to hide the label while preserving the tooltip and accessible name. Use `Tabs(showHeader: false, ...)` with external navigation to retain page content while switching.
